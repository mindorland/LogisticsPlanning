      <h4>About the project</h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        The aim of the project is to assist logistics planning decision making process
        in the early conceptual phase of building offshore wind farms to optimize OPEX with Visual Analytics. 
        Users can carry out spatial analysis by measuring distance between O&M harbor and site, and users have to provide their inputs 
        for the system to run accessibility modelling.
        The outcome of the analysis would be to suggest a vessel - between CTV, SOV, and Helicopter.
        based on CTV acceessibility and other user inputs.

      <h4>O&M in Offshore Wind</h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        Offshore wind energy is a clean and renewable energy obtained by taking advantage of the
        force of the wind that is produced on the high seas, where it reaches a higher and more
        constant speed than on land due to the absence of barriers. In order to make the most of
        this resource, mega-structures are installed that are seated on the seabed and equipped with
        the latest technical innovations. Offshore wind power provided 0.3% of global electricity
        supply in 2018, but the market has grown by almost 30% per year since 2010, second only to
        solar.
      </p>
      <!-- <p>
        Wind power is the most efficient technology to produce energy in a safe and environmentally
        sustainable manner: it has zero emissions, local, inexhaustible, competitive and it creates
        wealth and jobs.
      </p> -->

      <h4>About me</h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        I am Min Cho Dorland, master student of Software Design at IT University of Copenhagen 
        with a specialization in Data Analytics and work at PEAK Wind as O&M consultant.
        This application is part of the thesis. I apply my knowledge within Visual Analytics and web programming 
        to develop a practical tool needed in the Offshore Wind O&M domain.

      <h4>Software & tools</h4>
      <br />
      <p>
        Python and Pandas are used in the data extraction, preprocessing, and data modelling part
        of this project. HTML, CSS and Javascript with MapbosGL JS framework & Turf JS were used to 
        create the visual part of the application and spatial analysis. Javascript is also
        used to implement simpler deterministic decision-tree logics. 
        As template engine for the project, Flask, Python web programming framework was used.
